            <h2>creative process</h2>
            <p>When it came to starting my first draft of my print, 
                I followed the style of Jim Datz. I wanted there to be some sort of directional pull in the print along 
                with a cartoon-like effect. I started off drawing one character 
                and then closely joined another character to it. I liked this effect and 
                thought it would be a nice way to fill the page in a creative way. </p>

            <h2>silkscreen prints</h2>
            <p>After designing the pieces with Procreate, I translated these digital creations into physical art through the silkscreen process. This technique involves pushing inks through a fine mesh to bring my digital visions to life on paper. </p>

            <p>My artwork was selected for the 2023 Art & Design Juried Undergraduate 
                Exhibition and was displayed in Ringel Gallery from February 20 to March 10, 2023. 
                It was my first time having my work displayed, and it felt great to have my work on 
                the gallery walls for my friends, faculty members, and fellow students to see. :)</p>
