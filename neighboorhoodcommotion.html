        <div class="process-content">
            <p>when it came to starting my first draft of my print, i followed the style of Jim Datz. 
                I wanted there to be some sort of directional pull in the print along with a 
                cartoon-like effect. I started off drawing one character and then closely joined 
                another character to it. i liked this effect and thought it would be a nice way to 
                fill the page in a certain way.

                <h3>initial design</h3>
                <p>after receiving feedback from my peers, i realized the initial shapes
                    of faces on the page was very horizontal and it was hard to follow a direction. </p>

                <h3>final design</h3>
                <p>from my peers, i got the idea to move the ‘BANG’ drawing lower on the 
                    page such that it came off on the bottom and left side of the page. 
                    i then moved the cartoon faces higher on the page to create a sort of 
                    wave coming in from the top and right sides of the page. the expressions
                    of the cartoon faces were that of surprise to create some kind of story 
                    for the print. we don’t know what exactly is going on with the ‘BANG’ 
                    drawing but it seems to have garnered a crowd that is very interested in 
                    this drama.</p>

            <h2>silkscreen prints</h2>
            <p>after designing the pieces with procreate, i translated these digital creations into physical art through the silkscreen process. this technique involves pushing inks through a fine mesh to bring my digital visions to life on paper. 

                <br></br>
                as i wanted this print to come out cartoon-y and whimsical, i wanted to go for bright colors, the way Jim Datz did for his prints.
