                <h2>Chefly</h2>
                <h4> Personalized Meal Planner</h4>
                <p>
                    Chefly aims to limit the grocery trips by allowing users to plan their weekly meals from their saved 
                    recipes and create a weekly shopping list accordingly. Our app also allows users to store their recipes 
                    and organize them into personalized folders. Lastly, the app provides users with a fun relief from the 
                    ongoing pandemic with creative cooking challenges.

                    For this project we used Flutter for the frontend and Firebase for the backend.

            <h2>Demo</h2>
            <p> This project was one of the first software projcets I contributed to and was were I first learned about my interest in UI and design. 
                I fell into the frontend devloper role and felt a huge learning curve the Flutter as well as the thought process that goes behind designing an application. 
                While this is not my best work, it started my enthusiam for design and development.
