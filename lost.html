                <p>
                    I had quite a few themes I wanted to incorporate in my work for this project, but chose to go with the
                    concept of our confusing existence.

            <p>Many times we think who we are and what we do matters so
                much but in reality we are all collectively doing random 
                things to fill time in our short lifespan.
                Once I narrowed down on this idea, I began to create.

                    planets and stars. If you potentially zoom into their expressions, they are equally lost and
                    confused. This further exemplifies the idea on a larger scale.</p>
