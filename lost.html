                <p>
                    i had quite a few themes i wanted to incorporate in my work for this project, but chose to go with the
                    concept of our confusing existence.

            <p>many times we think who we are and what we do matters so
                much but in reality we are all collectively doing random 
                things to fill time in our short lifespan.
                once I narrowed down on this idea, I began to create.

                <h3>“lost and confused”</h3>
                <p>i wanted the image to
                    capture a variety of personas as we would see in our everyday life. we have a confused baby,
                    working dad, studious girl, hairstylist, gossiping aunt etc. these are the backstories i see
                    when looking at the characters, but the audience is free to come up with their own, based on their
                    experiences with people and life.</p>

                <p>to mirror the confused bunch of characters,
                    i personify the earth as also being a confused rock just floating around. it is surrounded by
                    planets and stars. if you potentially zoom into their expressions, they are equally lost and
                    confused. this further exemplifies the idea on a larger scale.</p>

            <p>after designing the pieces with procreate, i translated these digital creations into physical art through the silkscreen process. this technique involves pushing inks through a fine mesh to bring my digital visions to life on paper. </p>

            <p>my artwork was selected for the 2023 art & design juried undergraduate 
                exhibition and was displayed in ringel gallery from february 20 to march 10, 2023. 
                it was my first time having my work displayed, and it felt great to have my work on 
                the gallery walls for my friends, faculty members, and fellow students to see. :)</p>
